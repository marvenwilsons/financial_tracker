## 📊 **DATA CONVERSION SUMMARY**

Your credit card transaction data has been successfully converted to the format expected by your financial tracker app!

### **🔧 What Was Fixed:**

1. **Date Format**: `2019-01-03` → `01/03/2019`
2. **Column Structure**: Added required columns for your app
3. **Amount Logic**: 
   - Positive amounts (charges) → `withdrawn_amount`
   - Negative amounts (payments) → `deposited_amount`
4. **Balance Calculation**: Running balance calculated chronologically
5. **Description Cleaning**: Removed problematic characters

### **📁 Converted Files:**

```

**Before (Your Credit Card Data):**
```csv
Date,Posting Date,Description,Amount
2019-01-03,2019-01-03,Balance Protection (incl tax),43.29
```

**After (App-Ready Format):**

### **🎯 How to Use:**

2. **Go to Add Statement page**
3. **Select "Credit Statement"**
4. **Copy content from any converted file**
5. **Paste into the textarea**
6. **Click Submit**

### **💡 Testing Steps:**

1. First test with `sample_test.csv` (small file)
2. Then try `app_ready_2019.csv` for real data
3. Gradually import other years

### **⚠️ Notes:**
